# project-z-realtime-system-utils-charts

## Overview
I enjoyed using socket.io in a previous project which inspired me to recreate a system monitor that I always have running on my computer. Using socket.io and recharts this project sends data from an express server to the client where it is visualised in real-time.

It wasn't possible to deploy this because it needs to be run locally. To do this follow to following instructions:

First download this repository by running this in the terminal:

```
git clone https://github.com/cmtran09/project-z-realtime-system-utils-charts.git
```

Next run:
```
yarn
```
Then 

```
yarn serve:back
```
Finally navigate to http://localhost:5000/
